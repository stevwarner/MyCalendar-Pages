# MyCalendar-Pages

These are working example pages for the [MyCalendar plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/kurtjensen-mycalendar) for October CMS.

The pages should be saved in your active theme in a directory structure like:
- __"site/themes/demo/pages/cal/month.htm"__ the url will be like __"/cal/month"__.
- __"site/themes/demo/pages/cal/form.htm"__ the url will be like __"/cal/form"__.
